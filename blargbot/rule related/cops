Note 1: The Snopes source is a bit weird. The conclusion the author puts is that these claims are a "mix." But reading the entire thing, it seems to entirely support Dr. Kappeler, Dr. Harring, Dr. Potter, and Dr. McMullin's claims that these institutions were developed to protect narrow class interests, control minorities, and uphold ||slavery||. The disagreement from the author seems to be just that this implies something about the police today. As such, I hope that with respect to claims about the intended purpose of cops, this "Mixture" verdict does nothing to harm anything here.

{send;{channelid};**Summary and conclusion:** These sources are specifically to do with cops. Cops as individuals are, generally speaking, full of vices and disposed to wrongdoing. They are guilty of ||domestic abuse||, ||puppycide||, ||sexual assault||, and ||brutality||. The institution of cops itself was originally intended to protect narrow class interests and uphold ||slavery||. The institution of cops today is not only ||bigoted||, it is explicitly designed to be so, with cops admitting that they create policies ||specifically to arrest black people||. Both originally and today, the institution has ties with ||white supremacy||.

What is *not* specifically to do with cops is mere state law enforcement. The ban on cop apologia is __not__ a ban on discussing and defending the enforcement of state laws. Members of this community are free to explore the merits of law enforcers in a hypothetical state. But the defense of several contemporary actual cop institutions around the world is not allowed.

As a final note, the reason you see `(credit: <@some comraderino>)` is we hope that this will encourage members of the community to submit other sources for the mods to consider adding to this command for the purposes of education. This does not necessarily entail you being mentioned each time{semi} it's up to you how you are credited. Thanks!}}
