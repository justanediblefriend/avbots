  9;While concern trolling is a complicated social phenomenon, to the point that many concern trolls are unaware about the behavior they're engaging it, it can simply be said to be when someone poses as an ally but is in fact a critic. Concern trolling often frustrates substantial discussion and functions as a silencing tactic. Sensitivity to when someone, or even you, is concern trolling is consequently difficult, but there are some tactics worth recognizing. Concern trolling may take the form of:

__1. **Tone policing.**__ Concern trolls often say they are on your side, but shut you down because of your tone and don't engage with or appreciate the substance of what you've said. 'I believe in women's rights as well, but you're not being very civil with how you present your points. You just come off as angry.'

    __1a.__ An attitude that often manifests itself here is the idea that critics of injustice aren't worth listening to unless they are flawlessly patient and forgiving, even in the face of provocation.

__2. **False qualified support.**__ Concern trolls often start with an expression of agreement, or condemnation of the opposing side, but then silences those they are allying themselves with. 'I'm for women's rights too, but criticizing every little sexist thing men do is taking it too seriously,' 'I used to support BLM, but ultimately they go too far with their criticisms.' What marks these apart from genuine disagreement or criticism on the matter is they're tactics designed to silence or frustrate discussion on these matters by threatening to abandon one's status as an ally to some cause if people keep speaking up about some issue.

Being aware of silencing tactics in general can help with sensitivity to concern trolling.
